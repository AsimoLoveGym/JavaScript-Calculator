# JavaScript-Calculator

This is a JavaScript project for [Free Code Camp challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator)

Didnâ€™t use Javascript eval() method.

## How to Use:

Multiple and divide have no priority over minus and add, in this calculator, the calculating order is from left to right.

For example: 1+ 2 x 3 -1 = (1+ 2) x 3 -1 = 3 x 3 -1 = 9 -1 = 8

Not support for negative number input, but you can achieve any negative number by minus

For example: 1 - 3 = -2; and this result can be used for further calculation.
